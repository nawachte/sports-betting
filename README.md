A comprehensive exploration of NFL data, featuring exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and machine learning applications. This repository includes projects focused on over/under predictions and other analytics-driven insights, utilizing Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and more. 

1. NFL_analysis_and_EDA.ipynb
This notebook focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the NFL dataset. It lays the groundwork for understanding patterns and trends in the data, providing valuable insights for feature engineering and modeling.
Primary Focus: Data cleaning and initial analysis.
Key Features: Preparing the dataset for model development and visualization.

2. NFLouModel.ipynb
This notebook is the core of the project, implementing the predictive model for over/under scores in NFL games. It uses the cleaned dataset to train and test a machine learning model, optimizing for predictive accuracy.
Primary Focus: Building and testing machine learning models.
Key Features: Model training, evaluation, and performance metrics.

3. NFLoverunder.ipynb
This notebook provides calculation functions and aggregates multiple methods of estimating the total score for NFL games. It leverages the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculated during the analysis and EDA phase to fine-tune predictions. These aggregated predictions are used to inform over/under betting decisions.

Primary Focus: Utility functions for betting decisions.
Key Features:
Aggregation of multiple scoring prediction methods.
Use of MAE metrics to weigh prediction confidence.
Structured data management for team matchups and over/under odds.
